This simple app reads the data from the link provided https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json

The app uses Retrofit to call the API, then the list items are sorted by their ListID, and displayed accordingly,
I rearranged the list items for better readability.

Most of the code is in MainActivity.kt, but APIService.kt, Item.kt, and RetrofitClient.kt are all files made by me as well.

I made sure to use Fetch colors themes, let me know if there are any questions, and feel free to contact me at coleras0018@gmail.com!
