This simple app reads the data from the link provided https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json

The app uses Retrofit to call the API, then the list items are sorted by their ListID, and displayed accordingly

I made sure to use Fetch colors themes, let me know if there are any questions, and feel free to contact me at coleras0018@gmail.com
